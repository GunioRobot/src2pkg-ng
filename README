   src2pkg-ng is a complete experimental redesign of the src2pkg package
   creation tool.  The the primary difference in src2pkg-ng is the new
   scripting API. This new API follows the same general process as the old one,
   but is more explicit, transparent, and flexible.

   src2pkg-ng is unstable and not suitable for daily use. Those using
   src2pkg-ng must be fully prepared for the possibility that it may kill
   puppies. The scripting API may change drastically at any time. src2pkg-ng
   supports fewer build systems and sandboxing methods than src2pkg.

   The src2pkg-ng executable behaves like a command interpreter. This command
   interpreter does not yet support an interactive mode.  It cannot
   automatically create a package from a tarball, you must use a src2pkg-ng
   script. See the SCRIPTING_API file for details on the fuctions you can use
   in a src2pkg-ng script.

   In order to get vim to do pretty bash syntax coloring for src2pkg-ng
   scripts, add these two lines to your .vimrc:
   au BufEnter *.src2pkg-ng let is_bash=1
   au BufEnter *.src2pkg-ng set ft=sh
